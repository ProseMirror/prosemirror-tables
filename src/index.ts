// This file defines a plugin that handles the drawing of cell
// selections and the basic user interactions for creating and working
// with such selections. It also makes sure that, after each
// transaction, the shapes of tables are normalized to be rectangular
// and not contain overlapping cells.

// :: () â†’ Plugin
//
// Creates a [plugin](http://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#state.Plugin)
// that, when added to an editor, enables cell-selection, handles
// cell-based copy/paste, and makes sure tables stay well-formed (each
// row has the same width, and cells don't overlap).
//
// You should probably put this plugin near the end of your array of
// plugins, since it handles mouse and arrow key events in tables
// rather broadly, and other plugins, like the gap cursor or the
// column-width dragging plugin, might want to get a turn first to
// perform more specific behavior.
