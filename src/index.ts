 * cell-based copy/paste, and makes sure tables stay well-formed (each
 * row has the same width, and cells don't overlap).
 *
 * You should probably put this plugin near the end of your array of
 * plugins, since it handles mouse and arrow key events in tables
 * rather broadly, and other plugins, like the gap cursor or the
 * column-width dragging plugin, might want to get a turn first to
 * perform more specific behavior.
